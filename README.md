hello world!
I studied business administration for four years and while I finished this program, I enrolled in a computer science minor. I can now say that I have been learning computer science for one and a half years. I am excited by this latest technical branch of knowledge I have been devling into and hope to eventually land a job as a develop using primarily java or any other prominent languages.
