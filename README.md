Hello World!

I'm Computer Science minor student, which I realized was my major area of interest after graduating school. At the end of 2019, I chose to apply my computer science knowledge to technically challenging roles. While researching the job market, I stumbled upon an IT bootcamp that was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor. Operating under DCI Resources LLC, eligible individuals who applied to the 'TechHire Initiative' program would have the opportunity to boost their technical skillset. I applied, broadened and deepened my knowledge of core computer science concepts via studying and passing 6 certifications: ITS Java, MTA Software Development, MTA HTML5 Application Development, MTA Database, CompTIA IT Fundamentals+, and Intro to Cybersecurity. Now, I am more ready than ever to assist with all software development endeavors that make an impact. I held a couple of tech support positions, and now have a year's worth of web developer experience. I studied to be a full stack developer, though I have a slightly greater affinity for web development. Notwithstanding, as long as the job involves the production of quality software solutions to solve critical dilemmmas, then I am already allured by the nature of the opportunity.
