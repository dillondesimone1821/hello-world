Hello World!

I'm Computer Science minor student who ultimately turned to this discipline to be my major area of study! After graduating at the end of 2019 with my degree, I chose to apply my computer science knowledge in technically challenging roles. While researching the job market, I stumbled upon an IT bootcamp sponsored by the Department of Labor. Operating under DCI Resources LLC, eligible individuals who applied would boost their technical skillset. I applied, broadened and deepened my knowledge of core computer science concepts via studying and passing 6 certifications: ITS Java, MTA Software Development, MTA HTML5 Application Development, MTA Database, CompTIA IT Fundamentals+, and Intro to Cybersecurity. Now, I am more ready than ever to assist with all software development endeavors that make an impact. I held a couple of tech support positions, and now have a year's worth of web developer experience. I studied to be a full stack developer, though I have a slightly greater affinity for web development. Notwithstanding, as long as the job involves the production of quality software solutions to solve critical dilemmmas, then I am already allured by the nature of the opportunity.
