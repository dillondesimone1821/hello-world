Hello World!

I graduated college with a minor in computer science, which I realized was my major area of interest post graduation. Since the end of 2019, I applied my technical skills to a series of contract roles - each new role demanding responsibilities, increasingly more importance than the previous. While taking on contract roles, I enrolled into an IT bootcamp, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, otherwise operating as the 'TechHire Initiative' program. This opportunity boosted my technical skillset by exposing me to a greater understanding of modern approaches to software development. More specifically, I broadened and deepened my knowledge of core computer science concepts via disciplined study, which allowed me to pass 6 certifications: ITS Java, MTA Software Development, MTA HTML5 Application Development, MTA Database, CompTIA IT Fundamentals+, and Intro to Cybersecurity. 

Currently, I work as a web developer on a contract with the State of Connecticut. In my spare time, I continue to study core concepts pertaining to software development. My latest endeavor is to build as many side projects using the technologies I've learned, and ultimately earn a full time full stack software developer, back end developer or front end focused developer role. As long as the job involves producing caliber software solutions to solve critical issues withe people ready to collaborate to get the job done, then I am already enticed by the opportunity.
